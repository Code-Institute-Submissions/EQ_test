# EQ Test

EQ test is a test to your Emotional Intelligence. Emotional Intelligence is as relevant or more than IQ for a successful, happy life.
This test is based on Daniel Goleman work about brain and behavioral sciences. The test had been replicated from Paulo Vieira books as he uses it to access the EQ before and after the subject of his books and course materials.
